If missing, infer it from the technology most used in the latest job in the experience section. \n SCORE: Assign a numeric value from 1 to 10. Base this score on how well the JOB_TITLE matches the NAME of the skill. \n START_DATE and END_DATE values: Represent months in text format (e.g., 2021-JANUARY, not 01/2021). If only a year is provided, assume JANUARY of that year (e.g., 2020-JANUARY). \n STAGE_ID: Use a sequential numeric index to represent the order of each item in the list. \n If a skill is present, it must always include a key YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE and its value. This value should be obtained from the key EXPERIENCE and it should represent the amount of years of work experience that are related to that skill. \n Finally, calculate the total professional years experience from each job in the EXPERIENCE key. To do it calculate the difference in months between START_DATE and END_DATE values. If END_DATE value has Present or Current in the text, you must consider the given reference date but not replace it. In case, don't include more months of experience if there is no reference to the current date of work.Then, sum all months, convert it to years but don't round this number, then, assign this value to the key TOTAL_YEARS_OF_WORK_EXPERIENCE. As well fill the YEARS_OF_JOB_EXPERIENCE with the amount of years of experience for the job title."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ALEXANDR PANASEL \n Skills \n Core Java, OOP, Design Principles & \n Patterns \n Back-end and Database Skills \n Web and Application Servers \n SQL, JDBC, JPA/Hibernate \n PostgreSQL, MySQL \n Profile \n Education \n Master's degree: Software Technology \n 2018 \n USM University \n University   Mathematics And Informatics , Chisinau \n Engineer's Degree:  Faculty of Informatics \n : \n 2016 \n USM University   Mathematics And Informatics , Chisinau \n High school degree \n 2010 \n Gheorghe Asachi, Lyceum, Chisinau \n Employment \n Java Developer \n Apr 2022 Sep 2025 \n Crossinx, Chisinau, Republic Of Moldova \n Junior PHP Developer \n Nov 2020 Jun 2021 \n Unifun International, Chisinau, Republic Of Moldova \n X ++ Developer \n Dec 2018 Jun 2019 \n Ellipse Solutions, Chisinau, Republic Of Moldova \n 5 Designed, developed, and maintained scalable enterprise applications utilizing Java 8/11, with a strong \n focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Collections, Multithreading, Streams, and \n Lambda expressions. \n 5 Utilized relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) to write and optimize SQL queries, ensuring efficient \n data storage and retrieval. \n 5 Implemented unit and integration testing using JUnit, ensuring robust and reliable code. \n 5 Identified and resolved complex issues, significantly improving application stability and performance. \n 5 Collaborated with cross-functional teams using Git (GitHub/GitLab), promoting version control and code \n management best practices. \n 5 Applied Apache Tapestry framework to build robust and maintainable web applications. \n 5 Emphasized Clean Code principles, ensuring code readability, maintainability, and scalability. \n Key responsibilities: \n Technology stack:  PostgreSQL, MySQL, Java 8/11, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Jira \n Project description: A digital invoicing platform that enables businesses to create, send, and manage electronic \n invoices efficiently.
